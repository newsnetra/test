Hafizur Rahman, Doulatpur police chief, said a dozen cases have been filed against Lal Chand with Doulatpur Police Station, of which six were murder charges. Tipped off by an informer, a RAB intelligence team went to Hossainabad on Wednesday at 5 am, where Lal Chand and his cohorts were present in Laldaha ground. Sensing the RAB presence, the alleged terrorists opened fire at them and RAB retaliated. Lal Chand was eventually found dead while others fled the scene.",

His wife, Dolly, learned of his arrest only by talking to people present during the incident. They informed her that he had been taken by RAB-7, but no one could provide information on his whereabouts. She visited BDR headquarters, the police, and Dhaka Central jail, but was unable to obtain any information about him. Dolly attempted to contact Ahmed on his two mobile phones, but both were switched off. Dolly recounted to Human Rights Watch how she discovered where Ahmed was: A neighbor informed me on May 4 at night that there was a news report on TV stating that Ahmed was in the hospital, and suggested that I should go there. About an hour later, at midnight, I heard on the news that he had died of a heart attack. I didn't know what to believe, so we hurried to the hospital and found him deceased. According to Dolly, Ahmed had been in good health until his arrest. When she and her brothers went to Dhaka Medical College to collect his body, she noticed severe bruising. Her brother, who examined the body more closely, observed that the back area near the hip was completely black and blue, and there were severe lacerations on the legs and upper back. According to his family, a post-mortem report from Dhaka Medical College stated that Ahmed had been beaten on the lower half of his body. The family filed an unlawful death case with the police. According to his family, the police investigation revealed that Ahmed's body had been discovered near New Market on May 4, and that he had died of a heart attack.",

RAB personnel recovered a loaded foreign pistol and sharp weapons from the spot. Menhazul Alam, Assistant Director of Operations at RAB-4, said they had received prior information that the notorious \"Gangchil Gang\" of Savar would raid the CNG pump station. The gangsters swooped on the earmarked NR Filling Station at 2:30 am. As soon as the RAB-4 men arrived there, the robbers began fleeing the scene and RAB chased them. The miscreants fired at RAB men, and they retaliated. After the five-minute gun battle ceased, RAB took the bullet-hit Swapan to Savar Health Complex, where the doctors declared him dead. Major Mohammad Sarwar of RAB 4 told The Daily Star that they chased Rafiqul, also known as Sumon, and his gang during a robbery at NR filling station. Sensing the presence of RAB, the gang opened fire, prompting the security forces to retaliate. After the gunfight, they found Sumon's bullet-riddled body. However, the owner of NR filling station, Ramesh Chandra Ghosh, said he heard gunshots in the area but no incidents of robbery or shooting took place at his refueling station that night.",

Jinnah, son of the late Monirul Islam, a freedom fighter, was admitted to the polytechnic institute under the Muktijoddha quota, said his mother, Momtaj Begum. \"I had dreamt that my son would become an engineer, but the law enforcement agencies shattered my dream… It is really unfortunate that Rab called my son a criminal,\" she said. Jinnah's brother, Humayun Kabir, said, \"We will file cases against the alleged killer this week.\" Jashim Uddin, brother-in-law of Jinnah, read out a written statement at the press conference. Jinnah was a 6th-semester student of mechanical engineering and Mohsin was a final semester student of electrical engineering. Family members, as well as their teachers and other students, said Jinnah and Mohsin were members of Bangladesh Chhatra League, but they did not have any criminal records.",

According to Major Mohammad Sakhawat Hossain, then deputy director of the Legal and Media wing at RAB headquarters, RAB-1 had received specific information that a wanted criminal called Kamrul Islam Bappi was plotting a major crime at the spot. He claimed that criminals opened fire when the RAB team entered the building, and the team fired back in self-defense. After the shooting ended, RAB discovered a body, which they identified as Kamrul Islam. The deceased's family disputed the RAB claim, saying the victim's name was Kaiser Mahmud, and not Kamrul Islam. Kaiser, 24, also had the common nickname of \"Bappi\". An autopsy conducted on September 11, 2009, identified the deceased as Kamruzzaman Bappi instead of Kaiser Mahmud or even Kamrul Islam. Later, a probe committee formed by the Home Ministry found that Bappi did not die in crossfire, as reported to the media by RAB. The probe report refuted most of the other claims made by RAB. It concluded that it was evident that Kaiser Mahmud was wrongfully killed by RAB due to a mistake.",

RAB stated that Mohammad Ali, 30, a member of the notorious 'Shahar Ali group', died in the shootout. The incident occurred at 2:45 am in the grounds of Mirpur outer stadium. Commander Abul Kalam Azad, director of RAB media and legal wing, told bdnews24.com that Shahar Ali, the leader of the gang, died in another 'shootout' on September 12. In an attempt to apprehend Shahar's accomplices on September 13, RAB-4 member Major Sarwar sustained injuries. This incident further strengthened RAB's efforts to capture the criminals, he said. A RAB-4 contingent raided the grounds of Mirpur outer stadium early on Friday after receiving information that some gang members were having a meeting there. The criminals opened fire at the law enforcers, and a gun battle ensued. Ali was shot and fell to the ground during the exchange, but all his associates fled the scene. He was taken to Dhaka Medical College Hospital, where the doctor declared him dead, said Azad.",

However, Aminul's family members alleged that police arrested him from the Jasas office at Bijoynagar but did not bring him before the court within 24 hours. Instead, police filed an extortion case against him, they said.",

The Rapid Action Battalion (Rab), however, denied the allegation of torturing Mohiuddin Arif, 29, who was serving as an operating theatre technician at the hospital. The guards of Dhaka Central Jail brought him to Dhaka Medical College Hospital on Wednesday around 12:30 pm. The doctors declared him dead. The investigation report prepared by Executive Magistrate Mokbul Hossain yesterday at Dhaka Medical College morgue stated that marks of torture were found on different parts of Arif's body. Legal and Media Wing Director of Rab, Mohammad Sohail, said the allegation of torturing Arif by Rab is totally baseless as Rab personnel handed him over to the police on the day he was arrested. Besides, relatives of all criminals make the same claim after their dear ones are arrested, he added. He claimed that Arif confessed to Rab and the police about his involvement in the robberies. Arif's family did not know about his death until yesterday evening when the police informed them about it at his village home in Brahmanbaria Sadar upazila. Giasuddin, Arif's younger brother, told The Daily Star that a team of Rab-4 arrested his brother at their Pallabi residence on January 25 around 8:00 am. He said, \"After 12 hours of the arrest, Rab with Arif in their custody raided our house again when we noticed torture marks on my brother's body. He was groaning and pleading with my father to save him.\" Arif was handed over to Pallabi police later that day, and a Dhaka court sent him to jail the next day. Officer-in-Charge of Pallabi Police Station, Iqbal Hossain, said Arif and two others arrested with him admitted their involvement in two robbery incidents in Pallabi. Iqbal Hossain also said he did not find any torture marks on Arif's body when he (Arif) was handed over to them.",

He was a student of political science at RU and the social welfare secretary of the RU unit of Islami Chhatra Shibir. Chapainawabganj police superintendent Nazrul Hossain told reporters that the gun battle took place at the house of Toufizul Islam Tanu, a local Jamaat-e-Islami leader in Choitannyapur village under Shibganj Upazila. After receiving a tip-off about a meeting of some Shibir leaders and activists at Tanu's place, the police raided the house. \"As the police cordoned off the place at 2 am on Thursday, shots were fired from the house and the police retaliated. Upon storming the house later, the police found the bullet-hit dead body of Shaheen there,\" said Nazrul. The police superintendent, however, claimed that Shaheen was hit by someone from his own side. The police arrested JI leader Toufizul and his son Mahfuz, 27, from the house. The body was sent to Sadar Hospital morgue for an autopsy. Local people said that following the death of RU student Faruq Hossain on Tuesday, some people, including Shaheen, had taken refuge at Toufizul's place. Faruq, an RU mathematics student, was killed in an attack by the CS activists, the police said. Two cases were filed in this connection on Wednesday against some 600 CS members, including 64 who were named specifically. Shaheen's name was not on the list of 64, but the police said his name would eventually be included in the list as a suspect.",

Afraid that those knocking at the door might be robbers or miscreants, the family decided not to open the door. At one point, they saw that some people were watching the residents of their house from the rooftop of the building opposite. Soon after, the strangers broke the main door of the house and entered it. Mr. Manik, who was receiving medical treatment at the DMCH, told Mizan’s wife that around midnight on June 30 (early morning of July 1), the police tortured him and Mizan in custody. The police wanted Mizan to confess that he was a car thief, which Mizan denied repeatedly. Around 1:30 am, Manik and Mizan were taken out of the police station to an isolated open-air field. The police shot Mizan and Manik in one of their legs each. Both individuals fell to the ground. Then, SI Anis told them to run away if they wanted to save their lives. Mizan attempted to flee. Suddenly, SI Anis shot Mizan’s other leg. Later, the police brought both of them to the DMCH. According to the official record of the Emergency Unit of the DMCH, the police brought Mizan to the hospital at 5:45 am with bullet injuries in both legs. Mizan succumbed to his injuries at 7:30 am due to non-stop bleeding from the bullet wounds.",

The two were suspected members of the Julfiqar group, a pirate gang. The Coast Guard's contingent commander, Lt. Mushfiqur Rahman, told journalists that a joint team of RAB, Coast Guard, and the police had been searching for fishermen abducted by pirates. \"Around 4 am, we saw a pirate trawler and asked them to stop. But they opened fire on us, forcing us to retaliate,\" he said. \"At one point, five to six pirates jumped into the water and escaped. We found Afzal and Faruk's bodies in the trawler afterwards,\" he added. Mushfiqur said they recovered three shotguns, 10 cartridges, and a machete from the trawler. Patharghata police chief Mah-e-Alam told bdnews24.com that with the latest case, five pirates had been killed in encounters with law enforcement officers in the last month. He said the other three pirates were killed in a gunfight on June 11. Mushfiqur said around a hundred fishermen were abducted by pirates in the last few days.",

The elite force, Rapid Action Battalion (RAB), claimed that the death of Ratan, also known as Titas and identified by New Age as Alimul Islam Ratan, marked the end of an era for Lal Pataka. The alleged shootout occurred at Thandar Para village in Bagmara Upazila at around 1 am. According to a press release from RAB-5, the intelligence team at the Bagmara camp had received information that the top leaders of the banned party were meeting with zonal leaders to reform the party. The party had been without direction since the death of its former Rajshahi commander, Elahi Box Mithu, on August 25 in another shootout. Acting on a tip-off, a RAB-5 team positioned themselves at a mango orchard in Thandar Para village at around 1 am. When the extremists suspected the presence of RAB, they attempted to flee. The release claimed that when RAB personnel chased the alleged extremists, they started firing at the law enforcers, forcing the RAB personnel to fire back in self-defense. Titas' body was found, while his companions managed to escape after a 20-minute gunfight, according to RAB.",

Shirin Kabir, his widow, rejected the claim and said Biplob was a mineral water trader in Motijheel. She said some plainclothes RAB members picked him up from their West Rampura residence around 10:45 pm on Tuesday. \"This morning [yesterday], we heard that he was shot dead,\" she told The Daily Star. He was very close to local lawmaker Rashed Khan Menon, said Kamruzzaman, the owner of the house he had been living in for three years. Biplob left behind two children. According to RAB officials, a RAB-3 patrol team challenged a suspicious gang of four in Shahjahanpur Jhilpar area around 3:30 am today. Sensing danger, the gang opened fire at the RAB members who retaliated with gunshots, triggering a \"gunfight\". They also said they recovered a revolver and two bullets from the spot. \"Biplob was caught in the line of fire and sustained bullet injuries. At one stage, his cohorts fled the scene,\" said a RAB-3 official preferring anonymity. RAB officials claimed that Biplob was rushed to Dhaka Medical College Hospital where doctors declared him dead.

One Abdul Kadir, who lives by the railway track, said he saw Biplob's body lying on the ground at Jhilpar. Asked by the police, he helped them pick up the body in a police van yesterday morning. Another resident, Taslima, said she heard two to three gunshots but could not say if it was a gun battle. Tofazzol Hossain, Officer-in-charge of Motijheel Police Station, said Biplob was accused in three cases filed with his station but could not ascertain the charges against him.

Rab said Khorshed Alam, 34, was a regional commander of Lal Pataka, a faction of the extremist outfit Purbo Banglar Communist Party. He lived in Jatibari Rasulpur village of the same upazila. Khorshed had a number of cases, including five for murder, pending against him. Rab-12 director Lt Col ATM Anisuzzaman told The Daily Star that a team led by deputy assistant director Mafiz Uddin raided Char Tangrail village around 2:30 am based on information that a gang of miscreants was holding a secret meeting there. Sensing trouble, Khorshed and his accomplices opened fire on them, prompting the elite force personnel to retaliate. Khorshed died on the spot while his cohorts managed to flee the scene, the Rab officer said. Rab members later recovered a foreign-made revolver, four local guns, three rounds of bullets, and sharp weapons from the spot. A case was lodged in connection with this incident.",

Rab identified the deceased as Ranga Miah, 25, a trader of illegal firearms, whereas the authorities of a school in Sadar said he had worked as an assistant to the driver of a school bus, reports our Bogra correspondent. Describing the incident, Sumit Chowdhury, a senior assistant superintendent of police (ASP) and acting camp commander of Rab-12, told The Daily Star that his team, pretending to be arms buyers, had contacted a gang of illegal firearms traders and arranged a meeting in the Fire Service area. After extensive interrogation about the location of firearms, Ranga took them to an abandoned place nearby, from where Rab men recovered four cocktails and materials used for making explosives. Upon further questioning of the arrestees, Rab learned that Ranga and another member of the gang, Hafizul, had jointly purchased a revolver which they had hidden in a nursery in Rabibari area of the upazila. As the Rab team appeared at the nursery around 9:30 am yesterday, Hafizul began firing at them. He managed to flee but shot Ranga with his gun, injuring him, according to ASP Sumit. Critically injured, Ranga was admitted to Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College and Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries, hospital sources said. Miah's family claimed to New Age that Ranga was not an arms trader and that he worked as an assistant to the driver of a school bus.",

According to a press release issued by Rab yesterday, a team of Rab-5 raided Goalkandi village around 2:45 am after receiving information that a gang of outlaws was holding a meeting there to plan \"subversive activities\". Upon seeing the Rab members, the gang started firing at them. The Rab men fired back, and during the exchange, Mostaq was hit by a bullet while the other outlaws managed to flee. Mostaq was rushed to the upazila health complex where doctors declared him dead, the press release states. At least 15 bullets were exchanged during the gunfight, Rab said in the press release.",

Police and Bangladesh Border Guard (BGB) personnel opened fire to disperse the \"unruly\" activists, resulting in the death of Apan Babu (identified by Amar Desh newspaper as Abdur Razzak Apon), a 16-year-old son of Anisur Rahman from Tenganmari Kabirajpara village, according to bdnews24.com. Nilphamari Superintendent of Police (SP) Hatem Ali told bdnews24.com that BGB personnel were deployed in Jaldhaka upazila headquarters in the morning. Additionally, Section 144 was enforced in the upazila town from 2pm to 12am. The BGB personnel intervened when the Jamaat-Shibir activists tried to set fire to a bus in Rajarhat area around 3pm, violating Section 144. At one stage, the unruly activists also attacked the BGB men, prompting the law enforcers to open fire to disperse the pickets.",

Three alleged carjackers, including the deceased, Yasin Bepari, 26, and a constable of the Detective Branch of Police suffered bullet injuries in the incident. All of them, including DB police constable Azizul Islam, 30, were admitted to the hospital where Yasin died from two gunshot wounds in the abdomen. Yasin's father, Abdus Sobhan Bepari, a resident of Shibchar upazila in Madaripur, told The Daily Star that his two sons used to live in the capital's Begunbari area and drive pick-ups. On Tuesday, detectives arrested Korban and made a phone call to Yasin asking him to come in front of Golap Shah Mazar, said Sobhan. When Yasin arrived with his pickup, the DB police shot him and seriously injured him, he added. DB police constable Azizul, however, told The Daily Star that the miscreants opened fire on them first, and his team retaliated. His team is in charge of preventing robbery and mugging in Dhaka south zone of DB police, he added.",

The deceased was identified as Wahed Mohajan, 42, son of Abdul Aziz Mohajon of Kalikati village in the same upazila. Two policemen were injured during the gunfight. Tipped off that a gang of 8-10 robbers, led by Wahed, was preparing to commit robbery in the area, a joint team of police and DB men raided the area around 2:30 am, said Sadar police sources. Sensing the presence of police, the robbers opened fire at the law enforcers, triggering a gunfight that left Wahed dead on the spot and two constables, Monir and Mohiuddin, injured. Later, police recovered a rifle and a few bullets from the spot.",

Our correspondent reported that Shibir activist Rafiqul Islam, 23, son of Delwar Hossain from Boalia in Chuadanga Sadar, died on the spot after receiving a bullet wound to the head during the unrest. The incident took place during Shibir's nationwide demonstrations demanding the release of the convicted or on-trial leaders of Shibir and Jamaat-e-Islami. Witnesses said a procession of around 500 Jamaat and Shibir men, equipped with sticks and brick chips, attempted to vandalize a Durga statue in the Darshana Gate bazar area around 3:30 pm. Damurhuda police station Officer-in-Charge Ahsan Habib said the Jamaat activists began pelting stones when the police intercepted them. \"Police were compelled to fire 15 rounds from their shotguns, submachine guns, and Chinese rifles to dispel the gathering crowd,\" the OC said. Rafiqul Islam was taken from the scene to Chuadanga Sadar Hospital, where the doctors declared him dead, the OC said. The locality has been tense since the death of Rafiqul, who was a student of Bakibillah Kamil Madrasa at Badarganj in the same upazila.",

AKM Nahidul Islam, Superintendent of Police (SP) in Meherpur, said a team of joint forces arrested Jabbar from his residence at Hijuli village on December 30, 2013 in connection with recent violence unleashed by Jamaat and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir, in the district. During the interrogation, Jabbar disclosed the identity of the party members in the area, as well as a cache of arms possessed by them, the SP said. Shibir cadres, led by Abdul Matin, Khulna divisional coordinator of Jamaat, were scheduled to meet him in the village that night, according to Jabbar's statement. Following the confession, a team of joint forces conducted a raid in the village around 2:00 am on December 31, 2013. Sensing the presence of the law enforcers, Jamaat-Shibir members opened fire on the joint forces, while the law enforcers fired gunshots in response. At one point, Jabbar, who was staying with the team during the raids, jumped out of the police van to flee the scene and was caught in the line of fire.",

While passing by Kurusha-Ferusha Government Primary School, a member of the BGB's intelligence branch, Lance Naik Jalal, stopped him. Jalal challenged Sahidar, accusing him of possessing marijuana, leading to an argument between the two. Enraged, Jalal brutally attacked Sahidar with a tree branch, causing Sahidar to fall unconscious on the spot. Jalal then left him there and fled. Local residents rescued Sahidar and initially took him to Fulbari Hospital. Due to his deteriorating condition, he was transferred to Rangpur Medical College Hospital, where he died around nine at night. The company commander of Kurigram 45 BGB's Shimulbari company headquarters, Subedar Rahmat Ali, said that Sahidar's death might have been caused by a seizure.

Following the news report, both parties had filed written complaints against each other, according to the police official. The news of Sagar's death came around 8pm. Some locals suspected that he was pushed off the roof, but no one agreed to speak on record. Assistant Commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (North), Saifullah Mohammed, told bdnews24.com that the man died after 'falling from the roof'. When asked how it had happened, he said, \"Neither the police nor the principal of (Uttara) Trust College pushed him off from the roof.\" \"Shah Alam had no cases against him, so why would he want to escape?

Police had received a tip-off that around 50-60 Shibir men were holding a meeting at Mukul Hossain's house near Kamalnagar graveyard and planning to carry out violence. As the law enforcers conducted a raid at the house around 5:00 pm, Shibir activists exploded crude bombs targeting the lawmen, Enamul Hawlader, the officer-in-charge of Satkhira Sadar Police Station, told The Daily Star. \"Later, the Shibir activists opened fire, prompting us to retaliate with bullets,\" the OC said. However, the injured activists claimed that the police had surrounded the house and shot them after blindfolding them. Nur Mohammad, one of the bullet-hit individuals, said six of them, including Aminur, were staying in the rented house. \"Akhter and Azizul came to the house, and they were resting after having lunch. Suddenly, we realized that the police had surrounded the house,\" he said. At one stage, the law enforcers entered the house, blindfolded them, and shot them, leaving Aminur dead on the spot, he said.",

According to the hospital records, Jahirul, who was known as a 'cattle trader,' was admitted from jail on Saturday night. At that time, he was experiencing abdominal pain, blood loss, bloody stool, and decreased blood pressure. Jahirul's family and locals allege that before the trial in a mobile court, members of the Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) inflicted 'inhuman' torture upon him after his arrest. However, the BGB has denied these allegations. Relatives reported that in front of family members and villagers, Jahirul was tied up by his hands, feet, and waist, and was beaten on the ground. Nobody was allowed to intervene at that time. The deputy commander of the BGB's 18 Rifle Battalion, Major Shamim, stated that Jahirul was a noted drug trader and that no torture had been inflicted upon him. Therefore, the family's allegations are not true. He also mentioned that Jahirul was handed over to the mobile court by BGB members after being found with drugs.",

They saw two people in the van and asked them to stop as they were trying to drive away. At that time, the two men opened fire at the RAB team, and a gunfight followed. The pick-up managed to flee after a while. Later, RAB members found Zahidul's bullet-riddled body. He was rushed to Chittagong Medical College Hospital only to be declared dead on arrival.

The deceased, Bachchu Mia, was a CNG-run auto-rickshaw driver who had been traceless since being \"detained by plainclothes officials\" on February 17, according to his family members.

Sensing the presence of RAB members, Bachchu along with his accomplices \"opened fire on them\". The RAB team fired back, triggering the \"gunfight\", the official said. Later, the bullet-hit body of Bachchu was found and sent to Chunarughat Upazila Health Complex for autopsy. But the family members turned down the RAB version. \"My husband never touched a gun, let alone operate it. How come he engaged in a gunfight?\" said Bachchu's wife Rina Akther in a tearful voice. She alleged that two men in plainclothes on the afternoon of February 17 came to their house at Sundrateki village of the district looking for her husband. \"After talking to them outside the house, my husband came back and told me that the police asked him to meet them for some reasons. He did not tell me the reasons and went away,\" After a while, she called her husband on his mobile phone, but he was not picking it up. At one stage, she found the phone switched off, Rina said. Contacted repeatedly, the police could not provide any information on him, she added. Bachchu's mother Elai Bibi alleged that it was the RAB that picked up her son and killed him. \"My son was not involved in the killings.

The criminals eventually fled, but Delwar, who was wounded, was found lying at the scene. He was declared dead after being taken to Tongi General Hospital, according to the RAB official. The RAB claimed to have recovered a pistol, two bullets, a magazine, 196 yaba tablets, and Tk 10,000 in cash from the scene. Two RAB members were injured during the gun battle.

The deceased was identified as Kawsar, son of Amir Ali of Kamargram in Jaipurhat. Deceased Kawsar Ali, 25, was an alleged member of the banned militant outfit Jama'atul Mujahideen Bangladesh (JMB). An expert team of the Detective Branch of police and Shibganj police took position near Lohar bridge at Jamtoli village in Shibganj upazila after receiving information that some JMB men were going to carry out an attack in the area, said Senior Assistant Superintendent of Bogra police (B Circle and Media) Gaziur Rahman. Around 3:30 am, the team noticed at least three people carrying bags moving in the area suspiciously. They signaled to stop them, but the gang started firing, forcing the law enforcers to fire back. As the alleged militants managed to flee the scene, police rescued injured Kawsar and rushed him to Shaheed Ziaur Rahman Medical College and Hospital (SZMCH) in Bogra town where doctors declared him dead. They also recovered a foreign-made pistol, one magazine, two bullets, two cartridges, five hand bombs, and three sharp weapons including a machete from his possession. Two policemen -- Abu Raihan, 24, of Shibganj Police Station, and Altaf Hossian, 26, of the Detective Branch of police – were also injured in the “gunfight”. They were undergoing treatment at the local Police Lines Hospital. Kawsar’s body was sent to SZMCH morgue for an autopsy. On November 26 last year, armed assailants stormed a Shia mosque during prayers and opened fire on people, killing the muezzin of the mosque and injuring three others. Later, police in connection with the case so far arrested seven persons, who disclosed the name of Kawsar who played the key role in the mosque attack.",

The family of the deceased, Abdul Karim, alleged that he was tortured by the complainant before being handed over to the police, who also beat him in jail afterwards. Karim, 35, from Adhariatola village under Munshiganj Sadra upazila, was sent to DMCH for treatment from Munshiganj jail on July 21, 2016, due to severe chest pain, said Farid Uddin Rubel, jailer of Munshiganj jail. He claimed that when Karim was sent to the jail from the police station on July 11, he was already physically sick. Karim was first admitted to Munshiganj General Hospital for treatment and later sent to DMCH, the jailer added. Karim's wife, Moyna Begum, said their neighbor Md Shamim was building a house and Karim, along with others, wanted some money from him for arranging a picnic earlier this month. Later, Shamim and his relative Khorshed Alam took Karim to Shamim's office at Adhariatola and beat him mercilessly before handing him over to the cops on July 10, she alleged. She also alleged that a sub-inspector of Munshiganj Sadar Police Station tortured Karim at the station and damaged a part of his ear. Shamim also filed an extortion case against Karim the same day, and the police sent him to Munshiganj jail on July 11, she said. Moyna alleged that Karim's younger brother, Abdus Salam Khan, who was also detained in Munshiganj jail in another case, told her that Karim was groaning due to stomach pain on July 22, but when they called a doctor from the local hospital, he said that Karim had no problem. Sonjoy Kumar Poddar, a doctor at Munshiganj General Hospital, said that as Karim was seriously ill, he was sent to DMCH for better treatment. When asked about the reason behind his illness, the doctor said that they did not perform any tests on Karim before sending him to DMCH.

At least 15 people, including 5 policemen, were injured, some sustaining bullet injuries, when police opened fire during a clash with Baul supporters in the remote Darikandi village under Nilokhya union in Raipura upazila of Narsingdi last evening. The condition of two of the injured was said to be critical. According to local people, medical sources, and police, Baul Abdul Khaleque Fakir died 40 days ago. His followers, led by Abdul Hadi of Darkandi village, organized his 'chehlam' and the singing of Baul songs at his house for two days. Yesterday, they offered a mass meal and slaughtered a cow. The people and the organizers publicized the event, and several shops were set up at the place. However, a team of riot police from the Raipura police station attacked the 'pandal' (a large tent) and smashed the stage and furniture. As news of the police action spread, hundreds of irate supporters of the Baul arrived at the spot, resulting in a clash. Stones were pelted at the law enforcement personnel. The police finally opened fire, injuring 10 people. Local villagers rushed the wounded to the Narsingdi Sadar Hospital. Later, doctors there referred two men, identified as Jalal Uddin and Shamsu Mia, to the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) because of their critical condition.

Additional Superintendent of Police Mohiul Islam of RAB-1, Gazipur, said that based on a tip-off about cattle thieves escaping in a truck, the battalion personnel set up a checkpoint at Dakkhin Salna in the city. At around 3:30 am, the RAB personnel signaled a truck loaded with cows to stop, but the driver, disregarding the signal, attempted to flee, prompting the RAB personnel to pursue the vehicle. As they entered the village road and approached Majlishpur High School, approximately two kilometers away from the checkpoint, they became stuck. The suspected thieves then opened fire on the law enforcers, and the RAB personnel retaliated by firing back. Eventually, the suspects managed to escape from the truck. The battalion members apprehended Rafiqul, who had been shot, at the scene.",

According to the DAILY STAR, two 'Neo JMB' leaders have been arrested. One is a key financier of the outfit, and the other allegedly supplied arms and explosives for the Gulshan attack in 2016. The police claimed to have arrested Akram Hossein Khan Niloy, 26, who allegedly funded “Neo JMB” and was involved in all its activities. He was also the mastermind behind the Hotel Olio International blast in Panthapath on August 15 last year, according to a counterterrorism official. The other arrestee, Hadisur Rahman Sagor, 36, allegedly supplied arms and explosives used in the Gulshan attack. He is also said to be the brother-in-law of Nurul Islam Marzan, a top “Neo JMB” operative who was also a planner of the café siege. Marzan was killed in a “shootout” with the Counter Terrorism and Transnational Crime (CTTC) unit of the DMP on January 6 last year. A team of Bogra police arrested Niloy and Sagor from the Shibganj area of the district around 2:00 am yesterday and handed them over to CTTC personnel, said Mohibul Islam Khan, deputy commissioner of the unit. Police recovered two cell phones from the arrestees that “show evidence of their connection with militancy,” officials say. Later in the day, CTTC officials produced them before two separate Dhaka courts, seeking 10-day remand for each. The courts granted six days for Niloy and seven days for Sagor. Metropolitan Magistrate Aminul Haque passed the order on Niloy after hearing the remand petition. When the court asked Niloy about his past whereabouts, the suspect replied that he was in Malaysia and was studying at a university there, court sources said. When asked whether he knew café attacker Nibras Islam, who was also a student at a Malaysian university, Niloy got angry and asked Aminul Haque if he was a magistrate. As the magistrate replied in the positive, Niloy said, “You can remand or punish me, even sentence me to death, but I despise you and your order as I only obey the rule of Allah.” Hailing from Kishoreganj, Niloy is the son of Abu Torab Khan.

A team of Rab-7 raided the Pologround area around 3:00 am, acting on a tip-off that some arms dealers were trading firearms there, said Mimtanur Rahman, Assistant Director of RAB-7. He said that when the RAB team reached the spot, the criminals opened fire. The RAB members then returned fire, triggering the \"gunfight\". After the gun battle, the RAB team found a bullet-hit man and took him to a hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival. However, the victim's family said that Kalam went outside his rented house in the Baizid area on July 18 morning, saying he was going to work, but he did not return home at night. Md Ripon, the elder brother of Kalam's wife, said, \"In the morning, we came to know about his [Kalam] death from TV news. Family members of Kalam asked me to see whether Kalam was alright. I came to the hospital and identified his body.\" \"My sister's husband [Kalam] used to catch fish and look after their cattle in his village in Feni. He came here [Chittagong city] around six months ago. He used to work as a daily laborer. On July 18 morning, he told my sister that he was going to work in a vehicle as a helper,\" Ripon said. But the claim of exchanging fire between Kalam and RAB was not true as he had no firearm, he added.",

The Daily Star reported that an alleged robber was killed in a \"gunfight\" with the police in Kushtia's Khoksa upazila early yesterday. The deceased, Motiur Rahman Mintu, 28, was from Pangsha upazila in Rajbari. The police claimed that he was a listed robber and a member of an inter-district robber gang. The \"gunfight\" occurred at Shimulia Bazar on Kushtia-Rajbari highway around 3:30 am when the police went there after being informed that eight to nine robbers, including Mintu, were preparing to commit a robbery, said Nazmul Huda, officer-in-charge of Khoksa Police Station. Sensing the presence of the law enforcers, the robbers opened fire on them, prompting the police to retaliate, triggering the \"gunfight,\" the OC said. With bullet injuries, Mintu was taken to Khoksa Upazila Health Complex where doctors declared him dead, he added. The police claimed to have recovered a homemade gun, a pistol, and four bullets from the spot. Mintu was accused in seven cases, including two for murder, four for robberies, and one for abduction, filed with Rajbari's Pangsha, Kushtia's Khoksa, and Jhenidah's Sailkupa police stations, they said. Bdnews24 reported that the \"shootout\" occurred at Shimulia in Khoksha Upazila, said Kushtia Detective Police OC Chabirul Alam. The deceased has been identified as 30-year-old \"Mintu,\" who the police say was linked to an inter-district bandit group. The bandits had felled a tree across Shimulia Bridge around 2 am in an attempt to rob vehicles passing through the area, OC Chabirul told bdnews24.com. When a detective police team was dispatched to the area, the bandits began firing at them. \"Police returned fire and Mintu was hit by a bullet,\" he said. \"The other bandits managed to flee. Mintu was brought to a Khoksha Upazila Health Complex for treatment, where doctors declared him dead.\" The police have recovered two revolvers, three bullets, a saw, and three sharp weapons from the scene,",

Later, on early Sunday, a police team, along with Noor, went to the Jadimura hilly area in search of his accomplices. When the police reached the area, Noor's accomplices opened fire on them in an attempt to snatch their leader, prompting the police to retaliate with gunshots, which triggered the gunfight, the OC said. After the hour-long gunfight was over, the police rescued Noor Mohammad with bullet injuries and took him to Teknaf Upazila Health Complex, where doctors declared him dead.",

Police picked up Billal from Keshabpur upazila on January 7, 2020. Sensing the presence of law enforcers, Billal's associates opened fire at the police. Cops fired retaliatory shots in self-defense. At one stage, Billal was caught in the line of fire and died on the spot, according to the police. The Daily Star reported that a teenager, who allegedly abducted and killed a fourth grader, was killed in a \"gunfight\" with police in Jashore's Monirampur upazila early yesterday. The deceased has been identified as Billal Hossain of Fedaipur village in the same upazila. Aged about 19, he was a class-IX student at Gopalpur High School, according to the police. Shahidul Islam, officer-in-charge of Monirampur Police Station, said Billal abducted Tarif Hossain, a fourth grader at Gopalpur Government Primary School, on Sunday and demanded Tk 5 lakh as ransom from his family over the phone. He provided the family members with a bKash agent's number for sending the ransom money. The following day, Tarif's father filed a general diary with Monirampur Police Station. Police picked up Billal from Keshabpur upazila on Tuesday when he went to the bKash agent to collect the ransom money. They claimed that during primary interrogation, Billal admitted to abducting Tarif. Gleaning information from him, the police later recovered Tarif's body from the Satnol Bridge area around 3:00 am yesterday. Sensing the presence of law enforcers, Billal's associates opened fire at the police. The cops fired retaliatory shots in self-defense. At one stage, Billal was caught in the line of fire and died on the spot. The police claimed to have recovered a gun and a bullet from the scene. They also detained Lima Khatun, 20, and Masum Billah, 35, from their Keshabpur homes early yesterday in connection with the abduction. Law enforcers handed over the two bodies to their relatives yesterday after autopsies were carried out on them at Jashore General Hospital. Speaking to",

        "description": "Lt Mirza Shahed Mahtab, the camp commander of RAB-15 in Teknaf, said that a RAB team conducted an anti-drug operation in the Paharidhala area around 3:00 am. They acted on a tip-off that some drug peddlers would be smuggling yaba pills there. Upon sensing the presence of the RAB members, the drug peddlers opened fire. The RAB team retaliated, resulting in a \"gunfight,\" according to the RAB official. After the exchange of gunfire, the RAB team discovered three bullet-hit drug peddlers. They were immediately taken to Teknaf Upazila Health Complex, where doctors pronounced them dead, the official added. However, family members of Shahidul claimed that he was a trader. They alleged that at around 11:00 am on June 15, four plainclothes men in a microbus arrived at his shop on IBP road in Cox's Bazar town and abducted him. Shahidul's father, Abul Kashem, was present at the time and stated that the plainclothes men were armed. \"My son had been living abroad for many years. He returned home six or seven months ago and started running a grocery shop. He has not been accused in any case,\" he said. Kashem mentioned that the plainclothes men returned to the shop after two hours and provided them with a mobile number for contact. However, he was unable to reach anyone as no one answered his calls. After Shahidul's abduction, traders from Cox's Bazar town's Boro Bazar submitted a memorandum to the Cox's Bazar police superintendent, requesting assistance in locating Shahidul. They also informed RAB about the incident. However, all parties denied any involvement in Shahidul's abduction.",

The deceased was Sher Khan Mia (23). According to Palash police station OC Sheikh Md Nasir Uddin, on the evening of September 22, 2019, police arrested Sher Khan from Borab market in the upazila. On the way to the police station, Sher Khan tried to jump off the police motorbike he was riding and injured himself. Following the accident, he received first aid at the Upazila Health Complex and was then brought to the police station. Soon after, his condition deteriorated, and he was taken to Narsingdi Sadar Hospital and later transferred to Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH). On the morning of September 25, the duty doctor at DMCH declared Sher Khan dead. However, Faruk Miya, the older brother of Sher Khan, alleged that a six-member police team, including Sub-Inspector Iftekhar, Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) Monjur, ASI Rubel, Constable Delwar, and Constable Manik, arrested his brother. Police beat him mercilessly when he tried to escape from the motorbike. When the family members visited the police station on the night of September 22, they found Sher Khan lying on the floor in the lock-up. The on-duty constable said a sedative injection was given to him as he was feeling unwell. When Sher Khan did not regain consciousness the next morning, his family members started crying at the police station, and only then did he receive medical attention, added Faruk Mia. Faruk Mia further said that Sher Khan was a fish trader and there is no case against him. Faruk Miya claimed that his brother died because he was beaten by the police.",

Colonel Mohammad Faisal Hasan Khan, reported that, after receiving confidential information about a massive shipment of yaba coming from Myanmar via the Naf River, a special BGB team was positioned at a point near the Jadimora canal in the Noapara BOP area. A few moments later, as some individuals attempted to flee by boat along the Naf River coast with the drug consignment, the BGB patrol team challenged them, and the drug traffickers opened fire. During this time, three members of the BGB were injured. The BGB retaliated with gunfire. A four-to-five-minute exchange of bullets took place between the two sides. Once the firing ceased, one individual was rescued from the scene in a bullet-wounded state and taken to the Teknaf Health Complex, and then sent to Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital for advanced treatment. There, the attending physician declared him dead.",

Police arrested Shanu on March 23, 2020, from his home in Kalagachia village of Amtali upazila on suspicion of being involved in a murder last year. He was not accused in the murder case, family members and locals said. His wife, Jhahanara Begum, and son, Shakib Hossain, alleged that police demanded Tk three lakh in return for releasing him. As they could not arrange the money on such short notice, Officer-in-Charge Abul Bashar and Manoranjan Mistry tortured Shanu to death. Shakib said he offered Tk 10,000 to Abul Bashar on March 24, 2020, but he refused to take the money and asked for the full amount. On March 25, 2020, Shakib and his mother Jhahanara went to the police station to meet Shanu, but they were refused by the police officials. Jhahanara's brother, Rakibul Islam, said, \"I heard Shanu's scream in agony while I was waiting at the police station to meet him on the same day.\" Shanu was found hanging from the ceiling fan in Inspector Manoranjan's room on March 26, 2020, morning, according to Bashar. He added that Shanu was taken to the bathroom by a constable around 6:30 am. But he sneaked out of the bathroom moments later and hung himself. Manoranjan and Arifur were suspended for the allegations of Shanu's death. A three-member committee headed by Additional SP was also formed and asked to submit a report in three days.",

The incident occurred in the Khandakarpara area of Teknaf on Friday afternoon, according to Abdullah Md Sheikh Sadi, assistant director (Media) of RAB-15. The deceased, Md Ishak, 32, was a member of a Rohingya robber gang called 'Jocky Bahini', said the RAB official. He further stated that acting on a tip-off about a gang of robbers gathering near Khandakarpara in Teknaf, a RAB patrol team conducted a raid. Upon the arrival of the patrol team, the robbers opened fire at them, prompting the RAB members to fire back in self-defense. Later, they discovered Ishak's body with bullet wounds at the scene and transported him to Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital, where the on-duty doctor pronounced him dead.",

Police say the deceased, Shah Alam (45), was involved in the Yaba drug trade. The incident of gunfire occurred on Thursday (July 30th) morning during a mission to recover Yaba following an arrest. The Officer-in-Charge (OC) of Naikhongchhari Police Station, Md.

At that time, 10 to 12 members of a previously informed drug smuggling ring targeted the police to rescue the arrested drug dealer and opened fire. The police also returned fire, and Shah Alam was wounded in the gunfight. He later died on the way to the hospital.",

The release mentioned that a group of 30 to 40 suspected smugglers, armed with sharp weapons and sticks, attacked the BGB personnel while they were on their way to the BOP and managed to snatch two sacks of the seized bidi. Despite warnings from the BGB personnel, the attackers became violent and attempted to take the remaining bidi, which led the BGB men to fire warning shots into the air. The release claimed that the suspected smugglers then tried to take the firearms from the BGB personnel, prompting the BGB personnel to open fire in order to protect their lives and government property.

His brother, Dalim Mia, said, \"He was severely tortured. He was released on bail the next day but fell ill. We took him to the hospital in critical condition.\" Villagers later blocked the Sunamganj-Sylhet road at Pagla Bazar for three hours, demanding justice for Wazir. Superintendent of Police in Sunamganj, Mizanur Rahman, said there would be an autopsy, and actions would be taken if evidence of torture is found. He was arrested allegedly for stealing.

According to The Business Standard, a man was killed in a shootout as angry locals vandalized and set fire to Saltha UNO residence, the police station, and Upazila Parishad in protest against \"an assault\" on a man for violating lockdown rules on Monday night. The police allegedly opened fire in self-defense during the attack, killing Jubayer Hossain, 18, of Ramkantpur Union, according to Ramakantpur Union Parishad Chairman Ashraf Ali Litu. Four to five other people were wounded in the shootout. The incident erupted after a local man named Zakir Hossain was allegedly beaten up by the assistant of Upazila Assistant Commissioner (land) Marufa Sultana Khan Hiramoni at Fukra Bazar under Sonapur union. Zakir claimed that while Marufa Sultana was inspecting the lockdown enforcement, a man got down from her car and started to beat him with a stick without any warning. Zakir was taken to the Upazila Hospital with a severe waist injury. Agitated local residents later engaged in a clash with a team of police led by SI Mizanur Rahman of Saltha police station, forcing them out of the Fukra Bazar area. Following the clash, residents along with Fukra Bazar shopkeepers first besieged Saltha Police Station and Upazila Parishad office seeking justice for Zakir. At one point, they turned violent and set fire to the UNO's residence, AC Land's office, and the police station. Two vehicles of the UNO's office and several motorcycles were also burnt in the attack. \"Almost every government office in our upazila was attacked, vandalized, and set on fire in a medieval manner. They also attacked the Muktijoddha Mural and Muktijoddha Complex. We need a proper investigation into the matter,\" he said. Faridpur Superintendent of Police Mohammad Alimuzzaman said the public had misunderstood government instructions on the first day of the lockdown. \"At one stage, rumors were spread and various government offices were vandalized and set on fire. Eight law enforcement agency members were injured in the attack,\" he added. Saltha Police Station Officer-in-Charge Ashiquzzaman said",

After the gunfight, they found Shamim injured while the others managed to flee the spot. Later, he was rushed to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital where doctors declared him dead. The Daily Star reported that a man was killed in a \"gunfight\" between the police and criminals in Rajshahi's Godagari upazila early yesterday. The law enforcers said that he might have been involved in the rape and murder of a class-IV female student on Sunday. The \"gunfight\" took place around 2:00 am when a team from Kakonhat Police Investigation Centre was patrolling the Lalitnagar area, said Iftekhaer, who is also the spokesperson for the district police. Sensing the police presence, some criminals opened fire at the law enforcers, prompting them to fire back and triggering the \"gun battle,\" added the police official. When the criminals fled, the police team found a body, and locals confirmed that the deceased was Shamim. The police also claimed to have recovered a pistol, one bullet, a magazine, and a stolen mobile phone from the scene. The police official said that the mobile phone was stolen from the house of one of the neighbors of the girl, Sumaiya, 10, on the day of her rape and murder. \"As we found the stolen mobile phone in Shamim's possession, we are considering that he [Shamim] might have been linked to the girl's rape and murder,\" said Iftekhaer. The police collected DNA samples from the deceased and sent them to Rajshahi Medical College Hospital for forensic tests, he added. Sumaiya's body was found in a pile of straw on the roof of a neighbor's house on Sunday morning. Police investigation later revealed that she was raped and strangled sometime in the early hours of that day. Her father, Anwar Hossain, a mason, filed a case with Godagari Model Police Station against unnamed criminals in this connection.

There were also clashes in Cumilla, Chattogram, Kurigram, and Moulvibazar, where Hindu idols and temples were vandalized as the country observes Durga Puja. At least 50 people were injured in the clashes in Cumilla.

After the news spread that a man had been tortured to death by the police, a mob reportedly threw bricks at Haragach Police Station and vandalized a few police vehicles on November 1, 2021. On November 3, the High Court requested a probe report on the alleged custodial death of Tajul Islam in Rangpur. A four-member committee has been formed by the police administration to conduct an inquiry into the incident. The Daily Star reported that the High Court asked Rangpur police to submit the probe report, including the post-mortem report of Tajul Islam, and a copy of the case filed over the death by November 11. The HC bench of Justice Mamnoon Rahman and Justice Khandaker Diliruzzaman passed the order on a suo moto (voluntary) move after Deputy Attorney General Amit Das Gupta submitted a statement from the police on the incident. The statement said that the police had conducted an inquest on the body of Tajul Islam and found no injury marks. The bench set November 15 for passing further orders on the matter. A four-member committee has been formed, headed by an additional police commissioner of Rangpur, to conduct an inquiry into the incident. The committee has been asked to submit the probe report within seven days, according to DAG Amit Das Gupta.

Babul's daughter Munni said he was completely healthy and that the police beat him. According to The Daily Star, a man died in the custody of the Detective Branch (DB) of the police in Satkhira, hours after being arrested from his house in the district's Debhata upazila yesterday. The deceased was identified as Babul Sardar (56), son of the late Jurun Sardar of Basantapur village in the upazila, as reported by our local correspondent. Satkhira DB Inspector Yeasin Alam Chowdhury said that acting on a tip-off, a DB team arrested Babul from his home with 45 bottles of phensedyl around 11 am yesterday. He was taken to the DB office for interrogation after a case was filed against him with Debhata Police Station under the Narcotics Control Act, said the inspector. Babul \"hung himself from the window\" at some point during the night while in custody, said Inspector Yeasin. Talking to reporters, the victim's daughter Sultana Munni said an unidentified woman came to their house around 10 am yesterday and met her father in his room. Later, a group of 4-5 people, identifying themselves as DB policemen, recovered 45 bottles of phensedyl from the room and detained him after beating him up, she said. Munni alleged that the woman who met her father kept the phensedyl in the room. She also alleged that her father was tortured to death in custody. The victim's wife Sahanara Khatun claimed her husband did not commit suicide and demanded justice for his death. Satkhira DB Inspector Yeasin Alam further said the body was sent to Satkhira Sadar Hospital morgue for autopsy after an inquest report was made in the presence of a magistrate and a physician. Mohammad Mostafizur Rahman, superintendent of Satkhira police, said Assistant Sub-inspector Sheikh Sohel and Constable Sharful Islam, who performed duty in the DB office last night, have been suspended. The incident will be investigated, added the SP.",

The deceased, identified as Kawser Ali Mondal, 45, from Joypurhat's Panchbibi upazila, was accused in at least 12 robbery cases, according to the Rab. Just four days ago, Raju, 35, an accused in a murder case, was shot dead in a \"shootout\" with Rab members in Cumilla. Raju's death was the first such incident since the US imposed sanctions on Rab for rights violations on December 10, 2021. Khandaker Al Moin, Rab's Legal and Media wing director, said the \"gunfight\" in Manikganj also left two Rab members injured as some armed miscreants opened fire at their microbus on Singair-Hemayetpur regional highway. A window of Rab's microbus was shattered, and a tire burst in the alleged gunfight. The law enforcers retaliated, leaving Kawser dead, he said, adding that the injured officials were taken to the Combined Military Hospital in Dhaka. An attempted murder case was filed by Rab-4 against the victim, while a murder case was filed against him and several unidentified miscreants, since two Rab officials were injured, even though the only murder victim was Kawser himself. According to the first information report filed by the police, the incident occurred around 1:35 am. \"A critically injured Kawser was rushed to Manikganj Sadar Hospital, where he was declared dead by doctors at 5:30 am,\" claimed the FIR. The hospital is approximately 40 minutes away from Singair upazila. Furthermore, two of the witnesses named in the FIR said that they both saw a dead body lying on the road. \"I was home eating sehri. Our house is 300 yards away from the spot.

As the police reached the area, the criminals opened fire, forcing the law enforcers to retaliate. During the \"gunfight\", the police recovered the bodies of Junayed, Mehedi, and Ayub, who had been hit by bullets. The law enforcers rushed them to Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital, where doctors declared them dead. The bodies were then sent to the morgue at Cox's Bazar Sadar Hospital for autopsy. Two policemen, including an additional superintendent and an inspector, also sustained bullet injuries during the \"gunfight,\" he further added. The police claimed to have recovered seven locally-made firearms, five sharp weapons, and 25 bullets from the scene.",
